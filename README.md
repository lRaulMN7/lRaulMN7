My name is Raúl! I'm a 23 yo software engineer.

When I'm not coding, I love listening to and playing music, crying over golden sun 4 (make it already!!!!!) and trying to find my purpose on life :D

    If your creativity is driven by a desire to get attention, you are never going to be creatively fulfilled
